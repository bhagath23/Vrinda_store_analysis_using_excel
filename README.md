**Vrinda Store Data Analysis (2022)**
---

This project focuses on analyzing yearly sales data for Vrinda Store to understand customer behavior, top-performing states, monthly sales trends, gender-based purchases, and order channel performance.
The analysis is done using Excel, and the final insights help guide better business decisions.

**📁 Project Overview**
---
Vrinda Store received thousands of orders throughout 2022. However, raw data alone doesn’t provide clear insights. This project transforms messy Excel data into a meaningful business report by answering:

When do customers shop the most?

Who buys more — men or women?

Which states generate the highest sales?

Which platforms bring the most orders (Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, etc.)?

How many orders were delivered, returned, or canceled?

This project converts the entire dataset into a clean, understandable, insight-rich report.
